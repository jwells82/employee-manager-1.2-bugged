Every field must be populated to save
Information persisted after going to another name and then going back to new employee’s name

Action Items
Add employee functionality is not working as expected. 
Add Employee does not add a new file, but makes a space on the list. It doesn’t add New Employee to the list after Add Employee is clicked on. This is because there is no element for New Employee. 
Has new file card with new ID but fields are blank and has error message for each field
